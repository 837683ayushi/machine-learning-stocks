# MachineLearning-SP500

Playing around with scikit-learn, using S&P 500 data over the last decade scraped from Yahoo finance, the goal being to predict stocks that underperform(0) or outperform(1) the S&P500 index by training our model on 33+ features.

Features of scikit-learn used:
  - linear SVC
  - feature normalization
  - scaling data via preprocessing module
  - flat clustering using kmeans
